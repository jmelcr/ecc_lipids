\section{Residence times of cations}

In ECC-lipid simulations, 90\% of the calcium residence times are shorter than $60\,\mathrm{ns}$ for pure POPC bilayer
and shorter than $200\,\mathrm{ns}$ for POPC:POPS (5:1) mixture, while the
longest observed residence times are $141\,\mathrm{ns}$ and $485\,\mathrm{ns}$, respectively (Fig.~\ref{fig:hist_residence_times}).
The significantly shorter residence times in ECC-lipid simulations than in simulations 
with other force fields~\cite{javanainen17, catte16} suggests that 1~$\mu$s simulations in this work
are sufficiently long to equlibrate the ion concentration on lipid bilayer interface.
Interestingly, the calcium residence times are 3-4 times longer in POPC:POPS (5:1) mixture than in
pure POPC.

%Both estimates of the residence times come from simulations with comparable concentrations of around $250\mathrm{mM}$;
%the simulation with the neutral membrane has a bulk concentration of calcium $C_{ion} = 280\mathrm{mM}$, 
%whereas the simulation with the negatively charged membrane has a bulk concentration of calcium $C_{ion} = 240\mathrm{mM}$. 
%   In the simulation with the neutral membrane, 
%    90\% of the residence times of calcium cations are
%    shorter than $60\,\mathrm{ns}$, % exactly $53\,\mathrm{ns}$                                                                          
%    with the longest observed residence time being $141\,\mathrm{ns}$. 
%    In the simulation with the negatively charged membrane, 
%    90\% of the residence times of calcium cations are
%    shorter than $200\,\mathrm{ns}$, % exactly $53\,\mathrm{ns}$                                                                          
%    with the longest observed residence time being $485\,\mathrm{ns}$.
