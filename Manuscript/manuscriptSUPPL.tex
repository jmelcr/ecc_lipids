%% Meta-data block 
%% --------------- 
%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command. 
%% 
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author 
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given 
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional. 
%% 
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each 
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already 
%% assigned an affiliation. 
%% 
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This 
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere". 
%% 
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc. 
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis 
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.
