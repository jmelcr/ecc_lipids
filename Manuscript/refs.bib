   proposed. The force field employed for the description of the NaCl is
   based on a set of radial particle particle pair potentials involving
   Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic forces. The parametrization is obtained
   by fitting the density of the crystal and the density and the dielectric
   constant of the mixture of the salt with water at a diluted solution.
   Our model shows good agreement with the experimental values for the
   density and for the surface tension of the pure system, and for the
   density, the viscosity, the diffusion, and the dielectric constant for
   the mixture with water at various molal concentrations. The NaCl/epsilon
   together with the water TIP4P/epsilon models provide a good
   approximation for studying electrolyte solutions.}},

Journal = {{J. Chem. Phys.}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Non-polarizable models for ions and water quantitatively and
   qualitatively misrepresent the salt concentration dependence of water
   diffusion in electrolyte solutions. In particular, experiment shows that
   the water diffusion coefficient increases in the presence of salts of
   low charge density (e.g., CsI), whereas the results of simulations with
   non-polarizable models show a decrease of the water diffusion
   coefficient in all alkali halide solutions. We present a simple
   charge-scaling method based on the ratio of the solvent dielectric
   constants from simulation and experiment. Using an ion model that was
   developed independently of a solvent, i.e., in the crystalline solid,
   this method improves the water diffusion trends across a range of water
   models. When used with a good-quality water model, e. g., TIP4P/2005 or
   E3B, this method recovers the qualitative behaviour of the water
   diffusion trends. The model and method used were also shown to give good
   results for other structural and dynamic properties including solution
   density, radial distribution functions, and ion diffusion coefficients.

Title = {{Generic force fields for ionic liquids}},
Journal = {{J. Mol. Liq.}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{192}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{32-37}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ionic liquids have been intensively studied during the last decade, but
   many questions still remain unresolved. From the computational side
   there is the lack of good transferable force fields for molecular
   simulations that would allow accurate theoretical predictions and
   interpretations of the properties of ionic liquids. Within this article
   a method is described that allows for the derivation of partial charges
   for ionic liquids since they play a particular important role,
   particularly for a liquid that consists entirely of ions. Our partial
   charges are carefully determined in such a way that they incorporate in
   an average way the influence of polarization effects of the neighboring
   ions in a bulk situation thereby reducing the total ionic charge to
   values less than one. When combined with our recently introduced method
   for the optimization of the short-range interactions {[}1] we have a
   well described route to develop generic force fields for ionic liquids.
   In this article we describe our results for the partial charges for the
   three imidazolium based liquids {[}MMIM](+), {[}EMIM](+), and
   {[}BMIM](+) for three different anions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

@article{duboue2018insulin,
abstract = {In the present study, we characterize the binding of divalent cations to insulin in aqueous salt solutions by means of capillary electrophoresis and molecular dynamics simulations. The results show a strong pH dependence. At low pH, at which all the carboxylate groups are protonated and the protein has an overall positive charge, all the cations exhibit only weak and rather unspecific interactions with insulin. In contrast, at close to neutral pH, when all the carboxylate groups are deprotonated and negatively charged, the charge-neutralizing effect of magnesium, calcium, and zinc, in particular, on the electrophoretic mobility of insulin is significant. This is also reflected in the results of molecular dynamics simulations showing accumulation of cations at the protein surface, which becomes smaller in magnitude upon effective inclusion of electronic polarization via charge rescaling.},

@article{Duboue2018MgZn,
abstract = {Magnesium and zinc dications possess the same charge and have an almost identical size, yet they behave very differently in aqueous solutions and play distinct biological roles. It is thus crucial to identify the origins of such different behaviors and to assess to what extent they can be captured by force-field molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we combine neutron scattering experiments in a specific mixture of H2O and D2O (the so-called null water) with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to probe the difference in the hydration structure and ion-pairing properties of chloride solutions of the two cations. The obtained data are used as a benchmark to develop a scaled-charge force field for Mg2+ that includes electronic polarization in a mean field way. We show that using this electronic continuum correction we can describe aqueous magnesium chloride solutions well. However, in aqueous zinc chloride specific interaction terms between the ions need to be introduced to capture ion pairing q...},

abstract  ="Adsorption of metal cations onto a cellular membrane changes its properties{,} such as interactions with charged moieties or the propensity for membrane fusion. It is{,} however{,} unclear whether cells can regulate ion adsorption and the related functions via locally adjusting their membrane composition. We employed fluorescence techniques and computer simulations to determine how the presence of cholesterol-a key molecule inducing membrane heterogeneity-affects the adsorption of sodium and calcium onto zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine bilayers. We found that the transient adsorption of sodium is dependent on the number of phosphatidylcholine head groups{,} while the strong surface binding of calcium is determined by the available surface area of the membrane. Cholesterol thus does not affect sodium adsorption and only plays an indirect role in modulating the adsorption of calcium by increasing the total surface area of the membrane. These observations also indicate how lateral lipid heterogeneity can regulate various ion-induced processes including adsorption of peripheral proteins{,} nanoparticles{,} and other molecules onto membranes."}

@article{Verstraelen2013,
abstract = {For the development of ab initio derived force fields, atomic charges must be computed from electronic structure computations, such that (i) they accurately describe the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and (ii) they are transferable to the force-field application of interest. The Iterative Hirshfeld (Hirshfeld-I or HI) scheme meets both requirements for organic molecules. For inorganic oxide clusters, however, Hirshfeld-I becomes ambiguous because electron densities of nonexistent isolated anions are needed as input. Herein, we propose a simple Extended Hirshfeld (Hirshfeld-E or HE) scheme to overcome this limitation. The performance of the new HE scheme is compared to four popular atoms-in-molecules schemes, using two tests involving a set of 248 silica clusters. These tests show that the new HE scheme provides an improved trade-off between the ESP accuracy and the transferability of the charges. The new scheme is a generalization of the Hirshfeld-I scheme, and it is expected that its improvements are to a large extent applicable to molecular systems containing elements from the entire periodic table.},

@article{Hu2007,
abstract = {We develop here a new method to fit the molecular electrostatic potentials obtained in quantum mechanical calculations to a set of classical electrostatic multipoles, usually point charges located at atomic positions. We define an object function of fitting as an integration of the difference of electrostatic potentials in the entire 3-dimensional physical space. The object function is thus rotationally invariant with respect to the molecular orientation and varies smoothly with respect to molecular geometric fluctuations. Compared with commonly employed methods such as the Merz−Singh−Kollman and CHELPG schemes, this new method, while possessing comparable accuracy, shows greatly improved numerical stability with respect to the molecular positions and geometries. The method can be used in the fitting of electrostatic potentials for the molecular mechanics force fields and also can be applied to the calculation of electrostatic polarizabilites of molecular or atomic systems.},

@article{RESP_paper,
abstract = {We present a new approach to generating electrostatic potential (ESP) derived charges for molecules. The major strength of electrostatic potential derived charges is that they optimally reproduce the intermolecular interaction properties of molecules with a simple two-body additive potential, provided, of course, that a suitably accurate level of quantum mechanical calculation is used to derive the ESP around the molecule. Previously, the major weaknesses of these charges have been that they were not easily transferable between common functional groups in related molecules, they have often been conformationally dependent, and the large charges that frequently occur can be problematic for simulating intramolecular interactions. Introducing restraints in the form of a penalty function into the fitting process considerably reduces the above problems, with only a minor decrease in the quality of the fit to the quantum mechanical ESP. Several other refinements in addition to the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fit yield a general and algorithmic charge fitting procedure for generating atom-centered point charges. This approach can thus be recommended for general use in molecular mechanics, molecular dynamics, and free energy calculations for any organic or bioorganic system.},

The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123 to 573 K and pressures up to 40 000 bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions.

Izadi et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 5, 3863 (2014)], which permits a virtually exhaustive search for globally optimal model parameters in the sub-space that is most relevant to the electrostatic properties of the water molecule in liquid phase. Here we apply the approach to develop a 3-point Optimal Point Charge (OPC3) water model. OPC3 is significantly more accurate than the commonly used water models of same class (TIP3P and SPCE) in reproducing a comprehensive set of liquid bulk properties, over a wide range of temperatures. Beyond bulk properties, we show that OPC3 predicts the intrinsic charge hydration asymmetry (CHA) of water—a characteristic dependence of hydration free energy on the sign of the solute charge — in very close agreement with experiment. Two other recent 3-point rigid water models, TIP3PFB and H2ODC, each developed by its own, completely different optimization method, approach the global accuracy optimum represented by OPC3 in both the parameter space and accuracy of bulk properties. Thus, we argue that an accuracy limit of practical 3-point rigid non-polarizable models has effectively been reached; remaining accuracy issues are discussed.},

abstract = {Simplified, classical models of water are an integral part of atomistic molecular simulations, especially in biology and chemistry where hydration effects are critical. Yet, despite several decades of effort, these models are still far from perfect. Presented here is an alternative approach to constructing point charge water models - currently, the most commonly used type. In contrast to the conventional approach, we do not impose any geometry constraints on the model other than symmetry. Instead, we optimize the distribution of point charges to best describe the "electrostatics" of the water molecule, which is key to many unusual properties of liquid water. The search for the optimal charge distribution is performed in 2D parameter space of key lowest multipole moments of the model, to find best fit to a small set of bulk water properties at room temperature. A virtually exhaustive search is enabled via analytical equations that relate the charge distribution to the multipole moments. The resulting "optimal" 3-charge, 4-point rigid water model (OPC) reproduces a comprehensive set of bulk water properties significantly more accurately than commonly used rigid models: average error relative to experiment is 0.76{\%}. Close agreement with experiment holds over a wide range of temperatures, well outside the ambient conditions at which the fit to experiment was performed. The improvements in the proposed water model extend beyond bulk properties: compared to the common rigid models, predicted hydration free energies of small molecules in OPC water are uniformly closer to experiment, root-mean-square error {\textless} 1kcal/mol.},

In each case the simulations were run with both full ionic charges and employing the electronic continuum correction (implemented through charge scaling) to account effectively for electronic polarisation. The experimental data were then used to assess the successes and shortcomings of the investigated force-fields. We found that due to the very good signal-to-noise ratio in the experimental data, they provide a very narrow window for the position of the first hydration shell of the chloride ion.

    abstract = { We have developed the IPolQ method for fitting nonpolarizable point charges to implicitly represent the energy of polarization for systems in pure water. The method involves iterative cycles of molecular dynamics simulations to estimate the water charge density around the solute of interest, followed by quantum mechanical calculations at the MP2/cc-pV(T+d)Z level to determine updated solute charges. Lennard-Jones parameters are updated starting from the Amber FF99SB nonbonded parameter set to accommodate the new charge model, guided by the comparisons to experimental hydration free energies (HFEs) of neutral amino acid side chain analogs and assumptions about the computed HFEs for charged side chains. These Lennard-Jones parameter adjustments for side-chain analogs are assumed to be transferable to amino acids generally, and new charges for all standard amino acids are then derived in the presence of water modeled by TIP4P-Ew. Overall, the new charges depict substantially more polarized amino acids, particularly in the backbone moieties, than previous Amber charge sets. Efforts to complete a new force field with appropriate torsion parameters for this charge model are underway. The IPolQ method is general and applicable to arbitrary solutes. }

It was modeled by dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine lipids with net charge, sodium ions as counterions and water molecules. The behavior of this membrane differs from that was shown by other membranes without a net charge as a consequence of strong Coulomb interaction between atoms of adjacent phospholipids. The most remarkable effect produced by such interaction between neighboring lipids is a reduction of the surface area per phospholipid compared to an uncharged membrane. In addition, other properties of the membrane were also affected by this interaction between adjacent lipids such as the atom distribution across the membrane, the diffusion coefficient of the different components of the membrane and the order parameter of the phospholipid hydrocarbon region. Some comparisons of this membrane with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine membrane without net charge at similar conditions are presented. (C) 1996 American Institute of Physics.},

    abstract = { Binding affinities and stoichiometries of Na+ and Ca2+ ions to phospholipid bilayers are of paramount significance in the properties and functionality of cellular membranes. Current estimates of binding affinities and stoichiometries of cations are, however, inconsistent due to limitations in the available experimental and computational methods. In this work, we improve the description of the binding details of Na+ and Ca2+ ions to a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer by implicitly including electronic polarization as a mean field correction, known as the electronic continuum correction (ECC). This is applied by scaling the partial charges of a selected state-of-the-art POPC lipid model for molecular dynamics simulations. Our improved ECC-POPC model reproduces not only the experimentally measured structural parameters for the ion-free membrane, but also the response of lipid headgroup to a strongly bound cationic amphiphile, as well as the binding affinities of Na+ and Ca2+ ions. With our new model, we observe on the one side negligible binding of Na+ ions to POPC bilayer, while on the other side stronger interactions of Ca2+ primarily with phosphate oxygens, which is in agreement with the previous interpretations of the experimental spectroscopic data. The present model results in Ca2+ ions forming complexes with one to three POPC molecules with almost equal probabilities, suggesting more complex binding stoichiometries than those from simple models used to interpret the NMR data previously. The results of this work pave the way to quantitative molecular simulations with realistic electrostatic interactions of complex biochemical systems at cellular membranes. }

One approach uses an externally applied electric field, whereas the other maintains an imbalance of ions on the two sides of a membrane. We demonstrate that both methods provide converged results concerning structural parame-ters of the membrane which are practically indistinguishable from each other, at least for monovalent ions. Effects of the electric field on the detailed molecular structure of the phospholipid bilayer are also presented and discussed. In addition, we achieve a considerable speed-up of the underlying molecular dynamics simulations by implementing the virtual interaction sites method for the Slipids force field.},

This has motivated various efforts at using computational modeling methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to provide the missing information.

Although much information on the microscopic mechanism has been obtained both from experiment and simulation, the existence and nature of possible intermediates is still unclear. To elucidate intermediates of electropore formation by direct comparison with measured prepore formation kinetics, we have carried out 49 atomistic electroporation simulations on a palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayer for electric field strengths between 0.04 and 0.7 V/nm. A statistical theory is developed to facilitate direct comparison of experimental (macroscopic) prepore formation kinetics with the (single event) preporation times derived from the simulations, which also allows us to extract an effective number of lipids involved in each pore formation event. A linear dependency of the activation energy for prepore formation on the applied field is seen, with quantitative agreement between experiment and simulation. The distribution of preporation times suggests a four-state pore formation model. The model involves a first intermediate characterized by a differential tilt of the polar lipid headgroups on both leaflets, and a second intermediate (prepore), where a polar chain across the bilayer is formed by 3–4 lipid headgroups and several water molecules, thereby providing a microscopic explanation for the polarizable volume derived previously from the measured kinetics. An average pore radius of 0.47 ± 0.15 nm is seen, in favorable agreement with conductance measurements and electrooptical experiments of lipid vesicles.},

The ultimate goal of such detailed simulations is to produce trajectories in which the behavior of the system is as realistic as possible. A critical aspect that requires consideration in the case of biological membrane systems is the existence of a net electric potential difference across the membrane. For meaningful computations, it is important to have well validated methodologies for incorporating the latter in molecular dynamics simulations. A widely used treatment of the membrane potential in molecular dynamics consists of applying an external uniform electric field E perpendicular to the membrane. The field acts on all charged particles throughout the simulated system, and the resulting applied membrane potential V is equal to the applied electric field times the length of the periodic cell in the direction perpendicular to the membrane. A series of test simulations based on simple membrane-slab models are carried out to clarify the consequences of the applied field. These illustrative tests demonstrate that the constant-field method is a simple and valid approach for accounting for the membrane potential in molecular dynamics studies of biomolecular systems.

The results show that addition of cholesterol in concentrations of lipid:sterol ranging from 20 to 50 mol\% enhances substantially the membrane cohesion, which is manifested by an increase of the electroporation threshold (Uthr). This increase is steady in the case of the nsEP protocol, reaching roughly a factor 2 in the 50 mol\% samples. In contrast, for the msEP protocol, Uthr increases by 50\% upon addition of 30 mol\% cholesterol then levels off. Furthermore, pores formed under msEP are found to possess morphologies much different from the usually reported hydrophilic “electropores” encountered under the nsEP protocol, which may have profound consequences on the transport properties of “electroporated” membranes. Hence, this study reveals that cell membrane models containing the ubiquitous cholesterol component respond quite differently to the two electroporation techniques, in contrast to what has been found for simple zwitterionic bilayers.},

abstract = {This paper presents recent advances in the use of molecular simulations and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy, which enable us to understand solvated ions in solution. We report and discuss the EXAFS spectra and related properties governing solvation processes of different ions in water and methanol. Molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories are coupled to electron scattering simulations to generate the MD-EXAFS spectra, which are found to be in very good agreement with the corresponding experimental measurements. From these simulated spectra, the ion-oxygen distances for the first hydration shell are in agreement with experiment within 0.05-0.1 A. The ionic species studied range from monovalent to divalent, positive and negative: K+, Ca2+, and Cl-. This work demonstrates that the combination of MD-EXAFS and the corresponding experimental measurement provides a powerful tool in the analysis of the solvation structure of aqueous ionic solutions. We also investigate the value of electronic structure analysis of small aqueous clusters as a benchmark to the empirical potentials. In a novel computational approach, we determine the Debye-Waller factors for Ca2+, K+, and Cl- in water by combining the harmonic analysis of data obtained from electronic structure calculations on finite ion-water clusters, providing excellent agreement with the experimental values, and discuss how they compare with results from a harmonic classical statistical mechanical analysis of an empirical potential.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to examine the solvation properties and the ion-solvation shell exchange process of the K+ ion in liquid water, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. The solvent molecules are found to form well-defined solvation shells around the K+ ion and show a preferred orientational order toward the ion. The induced dipole moment distribution of K+ becomes broader and shifts to a larger average value from chloroform to carbon tetrachloride to water. It is observed that the K+ ion diffuses more rapidly in the aqueous phase than in liquid chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. We have also evaluated both ion and first solvent shell velocity autocorrelation functions and the residence time autocorrelation functions for the ion in water, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride. The residence time is found to be 9.4 ps for water and about 30 ps for both chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. By use of a constrained molecular dynamics technique, the first solvation shell exchange process is investigated. It is found that an estimate using equilibrium solvation and classical transition-state theory overestimates the dissociation rate of the K+ ion. Including the dynamical effects using Grote?Hynes theory yields more accurate dissociation rates.

@article{Abraham15,
abstract = {GROMACS is one of the most widely used open-source and free software codes in chemistry, used primarily for dynamical simulations of biomolecules. It provides a rich set of calculation types, preparation and analysis tools. Several advanced techniques for free-energy calculations are supported. In version 5, it reaches new performance heights, through several new and enhanced parallelization algorithms. These work on every level; SIMD registers inside cores, multithreading, heterogeneous CPU-GPU acceleration, state-of-the-art 3D domain decomposition, and ensemble-level parallelization through built-in replica exchange and the separate Copernicus framework. The latest best-in-class compressed trajectory storage format is supported.},

abstract = {Earlier, using phenomenological approach, we showed that in some cases polarizable models of condensed phase systems can be reduced to nonpolarizable equivalent models with scaled charges. Examples of such systems include ionic liquids, TIPnP-type models of water, protein force fields, and others, where interactions and dynamics of inherently polarizable species can be accurately described by nonpolarizable models. To describe electrostatic interactions, the effective charges of simple ionic liquids are obtained by scaling the actual charges of ions by a factor of 1/√($\epsilon$(el)), which is due to electronic polarization screening effect; the scaling factor of neutral species is more complicated. Here, using several theoretical models, we examine how exactly the scaling factors appear in theory, and how, and under what conditions, polarizable Hamiltonians are reduced to nonpolarizable ones. These models allow one to trace the origin of the scaling factors, determine their values, and obtain important insights on the nature of polarizable interactions in condensed matter systems.},

abstract = {Electronic polarizability is an important factor in molecular interactions. In the conventional force fields such as AMBER or CHARMM, however, there is inconsistency in how the effect of electronic dielectric screening of Coulombic interactions, inherent for the condensed phase media, is treated. Namely, the screening appears to be accounted for via effective charges only for neutral moieties, whereas the charged residues are treated as if they were in a vacuum. As a result, the electrostatic interactions between ionized groups are exaggerated in molecular simulations by a factor of about 2. The model discussed here, MDEC (Molecular Dynamics in Electronic Continuum) provides a theoretical framework for modification of the standard nonpolarizable force fields to make them consistent with the idea of uniform electronic screening of partial atomic charges. The present theory states that the charges of ionized groups and ions should be scaled, i.e., reduced by a factor of about 0.7. In several examples, including the interaction between Na+ ions, which is of interest for ion-channel simulations, and the dynamics of an important salt bridge in cytochrome c oxidase, we compared the standard nonpolarizable MD simulations with MDEC simulations and demonstrated that the MDEC charge scaling procedure results in more accurate interactions. The inclusion of electronic screening for charged moieties is shown to result in significant changes in protein dynamics and can give rise to new qualitative results compared with the traditional nonpolarizable force fields simulations.

In the uniform dielectric, all electrostatic interactions are scaled by a factor 1/$\epsilon$el. Since interactions are quadratic in charges, the effect of electronic dielectric screening can be taken into account implicitly by using scaled partial charges, qieff = qi/√$\epsilon$el; in this case, the Coulomb interaction between sites i and j automatically has the correct form qieff qjeff/rij = qiqj/$\epsilon$elrij without explicitly introducing factor 1/$\epsilon$el},

@article{leontyev09,
abstract = {A simple model for accounting for electronic polarization in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is discussed. In this model, called molecular dynamics electronic continuum (MDEC), the electronic polarization is treated explicitly in terms of the electronic continuum (EC) approximation, while the nuclear dynamics is described with a fixed-charge force field. In such a force-field all atomic charges are scaled to reflect the screening effect by the electronic continuum. The MDEC model is rather similar but not equivalent to the standard nonpolarizable force-fields; the differences are discussed. Of our particular interest is the calculation of the electrostatic part of solvation energy using standard nonpolarizable MD simulations. In a low-dielectric environment, such as protein, the standard MD approach produces qualitatively wrong results. The difficulty is in mistreatment of the electronic polarizability. We show how the results can be much improved using the MDEC approach. We also show how the dielectric constant of the medium obtained in a MD simulation with nonpolarizable force-field is related to the static (total) dielectric constant, which includes both the nuclear and electronic relaxation effects. Using the MDEC model, we discuss recent calculations of dielectric constants of alcohols and alkanes, and show that the MDEC results are comparable with those obtained with the polarizable Drude oscillator model. The applicability of the method to calculations of dielectric properties of proteins is discussed.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of a lipid monolayer at a water-air interface are used to investigate the dipole potential that arises at the water-lipid interface. One simulation explicitly accounts for many-body polarization effects by using a model based on classical Drude oscillators. The dipole potential of the Drude model monolayer is 0.35V in excellent agreement with experimental estimates that range between 0.3 and 0.4V, whereas, a simulation using a nonpolarizable model significantly overestimates the potential with a calculated value of 0.8V. Induced polarization effects in the nonpolar region of the monolayer are found to buffer the residual positive lipid potential that results from competing polarization effects at the polar water/monolayer interface. These results, indicate the utility of the inclusion of many-body polarization effects in empirical force field models of lipids.},

@article{chowdhary17,
abstract = {Additive force fields are designed to account for induced electronic polarization in a mean-field average way, using effective empirical fixed charges. The limitation of this approximation is cause for serious concerns, particularly in the case of lipid membranes, where the molecular environment undergoes dramatic variations over microscopic length scales. A polarizable force field based on the classical Drude oscillator offers a practical and computationally efficient framework for an improved representation of electrostatic interactions in molecular simulations. Building on the first-generation Drude polarizable force field for the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) molecule, the present effort was undertaken to improve this initial model and expand the force field to a wider range of phospholipid molecules. New lipids parametrized include dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE). The iterative optimization protocol employed in this effort led to lipid models that achieve a good balance between reproducing quantum mechanical data on model compound representative of phospholipids and reproducing a range of experimental condensed phase properties of bilayers. A parametrization strategy based on a restrained ensemble-maximum entropy methodology was used to help accurately match the experimental NMR order parameters in the polar headgroup region. All the parameters were developed to be compatible with the remainder of the Drude polarizable force field, which includes water, ions, proteins, DNA, and selected carbohydrates.},

abstract = { The Amber Lipid14 force field is expanded to include cholesterol parameters for all-atom cholesterol and lipid bilayer molecular dynamics simulations. The General Amber and Lipid14 force fields are used as a basis for assigning atom types and basic parameters. A new RESP charge derivation for cholesterol is presented, and tail parameters are adapted from Lipid14 alkane tails. 1,2-Dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers are simulated at a range of cholesterol contents. Experimental bilayer structural properties are compared with bilayer simulations and are found to be in good agreement. With this parameterization, another component of complex membranes is available for molecular dynamics with the Amber Lipid14 force field. },

abstract="In many technical and natural phenomena, adsorption at the interface actually takes place when the bulk solution adjacent to the interface contains several solute components. The organic and inorganic solutes present in the bulk may be nonelectrolytes or electrolytes, so that the solution also contains ionic and nonionic species of solutes. The aqueous solvent on slight dissociation may also introduce H+ and OH− in the bulk system. The organic solutes in the bulk system are usually surface-active, so that most of the time they accumulate in the interfacial phase as positive excesses. In the absence of organic solute, inorganic salts usually accumulate at the interface as negative excesses. But in the presence of organic amphiphiles, the inorganic cations and anions may accumulate either as negative or positive excesses depending upon the nature of the surface charge in the so-called interfacial double layer.",

These simulations are the first to model this gradient in all-atom detail, with the field generated solely by explicit ion dynamics. Unlike traditional bilayer simulations that have one bilayer per unit cell, we simulate a 170 mV potential gradient by using a unit cell consisting of three salt-water baths separated by two bilayers, with full three-dimensional periodicity. The study shows that current computational resources are powerful enough to generate a truly electrified interface, as we show the predicted effect of the field on the overall charge distribution. Additionally, starting from Poisson's equation, we show a new derivation of the double integral equation for calculating the potential profile in systems with this type of periodicity.},

abstract = {Advances in modern computational methods and technology make it possible to carry out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of complex membrane proteins based on detailed atomic models. The ultimate goal of such detailed simulations is to produce trajectories in which the behavior of the system is as realistic as possible. A critical aspect that requires consideration in the case of biological membrane systems is the existence of a net electric potential difference across the membrane. For meaningful computations, it is important to have well validated methodologies for incorporating the latter in molecular dynamics simulations. A widely used treatment of the membrane potential in molecular dynamics consists of applying an external uniform electric field E perpendicular to the membrane. The field acts on all charged particles throughout the simulated system, and the resulting applied membrane potential V is equal to the applied electric field times the length of the periodic cell in the direction perpendicular to the membrane. A series of test simulations based on simple membrane-slab models are carried out to clarify the consequences of the applied field. These illustrative tests demonstrate that the constant-field method is a simple and valid approach for accounting for the membrane potential in molecular dynamics studies of biomolecular systems. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane protein structure and function.},

@article{Roux2008,
abstract = {A theoretical framework is elaborated to account for the effect of a transmembrane potential in computer simulations. It is shown that a simulation with a constant external electric field applied in the direction normal to the membrane is equivalent to the influence of surrounding infinite baths maintained to a voltage difference via ion-exchanging electrodes connected to an electromotive force. It is also shown that the linearly-weighted displacement charge within the simulation system tracks the net flow of charge through the external circuit comprising the electromotive force and the electrodes. Using a statistical mechanical reduction of the degrees of freedom of the external system, three distinct theoretical routes are formulated and examined for the purpose of characterizing the free energy of a protein embedded in a membrane that is submitted to a voltage difference. The W-route is constructed from the variations in the voltage-dependent potential of mean force along a reaction path connecting two conformations of the protein. The Q-route is based on the average displacement charge as a function of the conformation of the protein. Finally, the G-route considers the relative charging free energy of specific residues, with and without applied membrane potentials. The theoretical formulation is illustrated with a simple model of an ion crossing a vacuum slab surrounded by two aqueous bulk phases and with a fragment of the voltage-sensor of the KvAP potassium channel.},

abstract = {We theoretically study electrostatic properties of electric double layer using a generalized Poisson-Boltzmann approach taking into account the orientational ordering of water dipoles and the excluded volume effect of water molecules as well as those of positive and negative ions with different sizes in electrolyte solution. Our approach enables one to predict that the number densities of water molecules, counterions and coions and the permittivity of electrolyte solution close to a charged surface, asymmetrically vary depending on both of sign and magnitude of the surface charge density and the volume of counterion. We treat several phenomena in more detail. Firstly, an increase in the volume of counterions and an increase in the surface charge density can cause the position of the minimum number density of water molecules to be farther from the charged surface. Secondly, width of the range of voltage in which the properties at the charged surface symmetrically vary decreases with increasing bulk salt concentration. In addition, we show that the excluded volume effect of water molecules and the orientational ordering of water dipoles can lead to early onset and lowering of the maximum of electric capacitance according to surface voltage. Our approach and results can be applied to describing electrostatic properties of biological membranes and electric double layer capacitor for which excluded volume effects of water molecules and ions with different sizes may be important.},

abstract = {Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations have become an important source of information for the structure and dynamics of biomembranes at molecular detail difficult to access in experiments. A number of force fields for lipid membrane simulations have been derived in the past; the choice of the most suitable force field is, however, frequently hampered by the availability of parameters for specific lipids. Additionally, the comparison of different quantities among force fields is often aggravated by varying simulation parameters. Here, we compare four atomistic lipid force fields, namely, the united-atom GROMOS54a7 and the all-atom force fields CHARMM36, Slipids, and Lipid14, for a broad range of structural and dynamical properties of saturated and monounsaturated phosphatidylcholine bilayers (DMPC and POPC) as well as for monounsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers (POPE). Additionally, the ability of the different force fields to describe the gel−liquid crystalline phase transition is compared and their computational efficiency estimated. Moreover, membrane properties like the water flux across the lipid bilayer and lipid acyl chain protrusion probabilities are compared.},

@article{vereb03,
abstract = {The fluid mosaic membrane model proved to be a very useful hypothesis in explaining many, but certainly not all, phenomena taking place in biological membranes. New experimental data show that the compartmentalization of membrane components can be as important for effective signal transduction as is the fluidity of the membrane. In this work, we pay tribute to the Singer-Nicolson model, which is near its 30th anniversary, honoring its basic features, "mosaicism" and "diffusion," which predict the interspersion of proteins and lipids and their ability to undergo dynamic rearrangement via Brownian motion. At the same time, modifications based on quantitative data are proposed, highlighting the often genetically predestined, yet flexible, multilevel structure implementing a vast complexity of cellular functions. This new "dynamically structured mosaic model" bears the following characteristics: emphasis is shifted from fluidity to mosaicism, which, in our interpretation, means nonrandom codistribution patterns of specific kinds of membrane proteins forming small-scale clusters at the molecular level and large-scale clusters (groups of clusters, islands) at the submicrometer level. The cohesive forces, which maintain these assemblies as principal elements of the membranes, originate from within a microdomain structure, where lipid-lipid, protein-protein, and protein-lipid interactions, as well as sub- and supramembrane (cytoskeletal, extracellular matrix, other cell) effectors, many of them genetically predestined, play equally important roles. The concept of fluidity in the original model now is interpreted as permissiveness of the architecture to continuous, dynamic restructuring of the molecular- and higher-level clusters according to the needs of the cell and as evoked by the environment.},

abstract = {In this article, we provide an overview of lipid simulations, describing how a computer can be used as a laboratory for lipid research. We briefly discuss the methodology of lipid simulations followed by a number of topical applications that show the benefit of computer modeling for complementing experiments. In particular, we show examples of cases in which simulations have made predictions of novel phenomena that have later been confirmed by experimental studies. Overall, the applications discussed in this article focus on the most recent state of the art and aim to provide a perspective of where the field of lipid simulations stands at the moment.},

@article{Mouritsen2011,
abstract = {Ever since it was discovered that biological membranes have a core of a bimolecular sheet of lipid molecules, lipid bilayers have been a model laboratory for investigating physicochemical and functional properties of biological membranes. Experimental and theoretical models help the experimental scientist to plan experiments and interpret data. Theoretical models are the theoretical scientist's preferred toys to make contact between membrane theory and experiments. Most importantly, models serve to shape our intuition about which membrane questions are the more fundamental and relevant ones to pursue. Here we review some membrane models for lipid self-assembly, monolayers, bilayers, liposomes, and lipid-protein interactions and illustrate how such models can help answering questions in modern lipid cell biology.},

These leaps have normally been associated with the introduction of a new technical advance or the development of a new biological preparation; therefore, it is quite certain that we have not seen them all.},

@book{MolBiolCell,
abstract = {For nearly a quarter century Molecular Biology of the Cell has been the leading cell biology textbook. This tradition continues with the new Fifth Edition, which has been completely revised and updated to describe our current, rapidly advancing understanding of cell biology. To list but a few examples, a large amount of new material is presented on epigenetics; stem cells; RNAi; comparative genomics; the latest cancer therapies; apoptosis (now its own separate chapter); and cell cycle control and the mechanics of M phase (now integrated into one chapter). The hallmark features of Molecular Biology of the Cell have been retained, such as its consistent and comprehensive art program, clear concept headings, and succinct section summaries. Additionally, in response to extensive feedback from readers, the Fifth Edition now includes several new features. It is now more portable. Chapters 1-20 are printed and Chapters 21-25, covering multicellular systems, are provided as pdf files on the free Media DVD-ROM which accompanies the book. And for the first time, Molecular Biology of the Cell now contains end-of-chapter questions. These problems, written by John Wilson and Tim Hunt, emphasize a quantitative approach and the art of reasoning from experiments, and -they will help students review and extend their knowledge derived from reading the textbook. The Media DVD-ROM, which is packaged with every copy of the book, contains PowerPoint presentations with all of the figures, tables and micrographs from the text (available as JPEGs too). Also included is the Media Player, which plays over 125 moviesanimations, videos, and molecular modelsall with voiceover narration. A new reader-friendly feature is the integration of media codes throughout the text that link directly to relevant videos and animations. The Media DVD-ROM holds the multicellular systems chapters (21-25) of the text as well. By skillfully extracting the fundamental concepts from this enormous and ever-growing field, the authors tell the story of cell biology, and thereby create a coherent framework through which readers may approach and enjoy this subject that is so central to all of biology. There is also a reference edition of Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fifth Edition (ISBN 978-0-8153-4111-6) that contains Chapters 1-25 entirely in printed format.},

@article{Storace2015,
abstract = {Organic voltage-sensitive dyes offer very high spatial and temporal resolution for imaging neuronal function. However these dyes suffer from the drawbacks of non-specificity of cell staining and low accessibility of the dye to some cell types. Further progress in imaging activity is expected from the development of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors of membrane potential. Cell type specificity of expression of these fluorescent protein (FP) voltage sensors can be obtained via several different mechanisms. One is cell type specificity of infection by individual virus subtypes. A second mechanism is specificity of promoter expression in individual cell types. A third, depends on the offspring of transgenic animals with cell type specific expression of cre recombinase mated with an animal that has the DNA for the FP voltage sensor in all of its cells but its expression is dependent on the recombinase activity. Challenges remain. First, the response time constants of many of the new FP voltage sensors are slower (2-10 ms) than those of organic dyes. This results in a relatively small fractional fluorescence change, $\Delta$F/F, for action potentials. Second, the largest signal presently available is only {\~{}}40{\%} for a 100 mV depolarization and many of the new probes have signals that are substantially smaller. Large signals are especially important when attempting to detect fast events because the shorter measurement interval results in a relatively small number of detected photons and therefore a relatively large shot noise (see Chap. 1). Another kind of challenge has occurred when attempts were made to transition from one species to another or from one cell type to another or from cell culture to in vivo measurements.Several laboratories have recently described a number of novel FP voltage sensors. Here we attempt to critically review the current status of these developments in terms of signal size, time course, and in vivo function.},

abstract = {FRET (F{\"{o}}rster Resonance Energy Transfer)-based protein voltage sensors can be useful for monitoring neuronal activity in vivo because the ratio of signals between the donor and acceptor pair reduces common sources of noise such as heart beat artifacts. We improved the performance of FRET based genetically encoded Fluorescent Protein (FP) voltage sensors by optimizing the location of donor and acceptor FPs flanking the voltage sensitive domain of the Ciona intestinalis voltage sensitive phosphatase. First, we created 39 different "Nabi1" constructs by positioning the donor FP, UKG, at 8 different locations downstream of the voltage-sensing domain and the acceptor FP, mKO, at 6 positions upstream. Several of these combinations resulted in large voltage dependent signals and relatively fast kinetics. Nabi1 probes responded with signal size up to 11{\%} $\Delta$F/F for a 100 mV depolarization and fast response time constants both for signal activation ({\~{}}2 ms) and signal decay ({\~{}}3 ms). We improved expression in neuronal cells by replacing the mKO and UKG FRET pair with Clover (donor FP) and mRuby2 (acceptor FP) to create Nabi2 probes. Nabi2 probes also had large signals and relatively fast time constants in HEK293 cells. In primary neuronal culture, a Nabi2 probe was able to differentiate individual action potentials at 45 Hz.},

abstract = {Calcium ion is the ubiquitous messenger in cells and plays a key role in neuronal signaling and fusion of synaptic vesicles. These vesicles are typically ∼20–50 nm in diameter, and thus their interaction with calcium ions cannot be modeled faithfully with a conventional flat membrane bilayer setup. Within our newly developed molecular dynamics simulations setup, we characterize here interactions of the calcium ion with curved membrane interfaces with atomistic detail. The present molecular dynamics simulations together with time-dependent fluorescence shift experiments suggest that the mode and strength of interaction of calcium ion with a phospholipid bilayer depends on its curvature. Potential of mean force calculations demonstrate that the binding of calcium ion to the positively curved side of the bilayer is significantly stronger compared with that to a flat membrane.},
