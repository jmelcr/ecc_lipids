\textbf{Main message: 
ECC generally improves interaction and structure of both neutral and charged molecules. 
Polarizability is necessarry for accurate simulations of cellular membranes at physiological ionic conditions.} 

%%% SAMULI: I commented this out because it way too general. We can write abstract later when the final content is clear.

%Binding affinities and stoichiometries of sodium and calcium ions to phospholipid bilayers are of paramount significance in the properties and functionality of cellular membranes. Current estimates of binding affinities and stoichiometries of cations are, however, controversial due to limitations in the available experimental and theoretical methods. Experimentally one can assess these parameters by titrating several membrane properties as a function of the ion concentration. However, the interpretation of the experiments relies on theoretical models, as direct molecular information is not available. 

%Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide details of the ion binding process with atomistic resolution, therefore offering all the necessary information to interpret experimental data without the need to resort to over-simplified models. However, the accuracy of the currently available lipid models when interacting with ions is not sufficient for such interpretation \cite{catte16}. Recently, we have improved the binding details of sodium and calcium ions to the 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer by implicitly including electronic polarization as a mean field correction, known as the electronic continuum correction (ECC). Our improved ECC-POPC model reproduces not only the experimentally measured structural parameters for the ion-free membrane, but also improves significantly the response of lipid head group to a bound positive charge, and the binding affinities of sodium and calcium ions. \cite{melcr18}

%We are now extending our work to other lipid membranes composed of larger varieties of different biologically relevant lipids. In particular, we focus our attention on membranes with 
%	%phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and 
%	negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids. 
%	We compare available NMR and x-ray experiments with MD simulations to obtain atomistic-resolution picture of the interactions between cations and phospholipid membranes. Our results indicate that electronic polarization is a non-negligable interaction, which dramatically improves the description of cation binding to phospholipid membranes.

\section{Introduction} 

Lipids with negatively charged headgroups, like phophatidylserine
play important role in biomembranes. 
Signaling molecules in cells interact with lipid membranes 
due to specific, often electrostatically driven, interactions 
with anionic lipids \cite{lemmon08,leventis10}.
Anionic lipids and their interactions with ions play also role in membrane
fusion \cite{??}. \todo{Pavel can probably improve this and give a citation}
These interactions depend both on
the chemical details of lipid headgroups as well as 
on the binding of counter and co-ions to anionic membranes. 

Various interaction schemes have been proposed for the negatively charged
lipids with ions and other lipids. 
Some studies suggest that the
binding constant of ions to negatively charged lipids is similar to that of zwitterionic lipids,
and the binding affinity is increased only due to the increased cation
concentration in the vicinity of the membrane \cite{seelig90,sinn06}.
On the other hand, calcium forms dehydrated complexes with PS headgroups
which cause phase separation \cite{hauser77,kurland79,hauser85,feigenson86,mattai89,roux90,roux91,boettcher11}.
Different theories are difficult to evaluate experimentally,
especially with physiological ion concentrations which are typically quite low.

Spectroscopic experiments give detailed information about the
interactions between ions and PS lipids, but the data is often indirect and difficult to
interpret \cite{hauser77,kurland79,eisenberg79,hauser83,dluhy83,hauser85,feigenson86,mattai89,roux90,roux91,boettcher11}.
Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations give
access to all the details, but the current non-polarizable force fields are not
sufficiently accurate to interpret the interactions between anionic
lipid headgroups and other lipids or ions \cite{NMRlipidsIV}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% On the simulation part .. %%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%From the perspective of phospholipid bilayers,
There are force field parameters for neutral lipids PC and PE 
with explicit polarizability using the Classical Durde model. \cite{chowdhary13, chowdhary17}
While such a model shows a potential improvement over non-polarizable force fields from many perspectives -- 
for example accounting for polarizability has a significant impact on the dipole potential of a membrane \cite{harder2009} -- 
the non-polarizable version of the same force field 
performes comparably well at a fraction of the computational cost 
of the models with explicit polarization. \citep{lucas12,chowdhary13} 

Short paragraph describing previous MD-work on this topic (PS), i.e., \dots 
\todo{SAMULI: Controversies in previous simulations (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2018.08.044 and
  Melcrova et al. Scientific Reports | 6:38035 | DOI: 10.1038/srep38035) should be mentioned also
in the intro.}

The interaction of various cations including calcium 
with  neutral and also negatively charged lipid bilayers
was thoroughly compared between simulations and experiments 
from the point of the electrometer concept \cite{roux90, seelig87, altenbach84}
in the references~\citenum{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4}. 
It was concluded that the interaction of calcium with zwitterionic PC bilayers 
is generally overestimated in all studied models \cite{catte16},
while none of the models was capable of interpreting the NMR structural parameters
with the negatively charged PC:PS (5:1) bilayers \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}. 
Accounting for the electronic polarization was identified as 
a non-negligible correction to the interaction between cations and POPC bilayers in Ref.~\cite{melcr18}. 

Here, we demonstrate that the same approach 
significantly improves the description of calcium binding 
also to the negatively charged PC:PS (5:1) bilayers. 
In correspondence with the Ref.~\citenum{nmrlipids_proj4},
we also use the changes of the head group order parameters $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ 
in PC and PS lipids 
to quantify the binding affinity of the calcium cations
and the induced structural changes
(Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS}). 
To directly connect to the previous works \citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4}
and to mark the improvement after treating electronic polarizability, 
we show simulation results from the newly developed ECC-lipids and also from Lipid17 \citep{lipid17-future}. 

An empirical scaling factor, which reduces electrostatic forces between molecules, 
is a well known concept in molecular modelling;
such an approach was adopted in the early simulations of lipid bilayers \cite{egberts94, berendsen1996},
in force fields employing explicit polarization \cite{lemkul2016empirical},
or in the simulations of ionic liquids \cite{Bhargava2007}. 
%An improvement of permeability of charged solutes in the gramicidin A channel 
%is observed with a force field using charge equilibration to model polarizability. \cite{lucas2012} 
At the same time, 
the implicit inclusion of electronic polarizability to lipid models
via charge re-scaling using electronic continuum correction (ECC) 
substantially improved the interactions between cations and zwitterionic lipids \cite{melcr18}. 


Here, we extend the approach to anionic PS lipids.
The newly developed model termed ECC-POPS 
not only describes the interactions of PS with ions more accurately, 
but also improves the structure of the PS head group 
and its interactions with PC in mixed lipid bilayers. 
The results pave the way to more realistic MD simulations 
of both neutral and negatively charged lipid bilayers 
for a wide range of applications.


 
\section{Methods} 
 
\subsection{Electronic continuum correction for PS lipids}\label{section:ecc} 

\todo{Joe: this paragraph requires editing.}
The lack of electronic polarizability has been a concern since the
early days of classical MD simulations of lipids \cite{jonsson86,egberts94, berendsen1996},
where the atomic charges were scaled by a factor of 1/2 to effectively
include the electrostatic screening from the missing electronic polarizability.
The electronic continuum correction (ECC) is a more sophisticated version of the charge scaling.

The polarization of electrons in ECC-lipids uses the implicit method termed electronic continuum correction (ECC). \cite{leontyev09, Pluharova2014, martinek17, melcr18} 
In this method, a system of polarizable particles is represented 
with an equivalent system of particles with fixed charges,
which account for the electronic polarizability \emph{implicitly}. 
This is practically achieved by rescaling the charges with a pre-determined scaling factor, $f_q$,
which is derived from the high-frequency dielectric constant of electrons, $\epsilon_{el}$, as
\begin{equation}
  f_q = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{el}}} ,
\end{equation}
The value of $\epsilon_{el} = 1.78$ for water solutions gives the scaling
factor of $f_q \approx 0.75$ for aquaeous environments \cite{leontyev09}.
This has been recently applied to improve classical models for ions and
other biomolecules \cite{Pluharova2014, martinek17, melcr18}
\todo{Pavel can probably update this (insulin?)}.

Recently we applied the ECC also to the Amber based lipid14 force field \cite{dickson14} to
improve the cation binding affinity to zwitterionic POPC lipid bilayers \cite{melcr18}.
In contrast to the total charge of ions, 
the partial charges in force fields of zwitterionic molecules
depend on the methods used to derive the force field, 
which may already partially include the
electronic polarizability effects. Therefore, the optimal scaling factor for charges in
zwitterionic lipids may vary from (be even larger) than the theoretically derived $f_q \approx 0.75$.
In the recent work, we found optimal results for cation binding affinity and
bilayer structural properties when the partial charges and Lennard-Jones~$\sigma$
parameters of all non-tail atoms of the lipid14 POPC model
(i.e., headgroup, glycerol backbone, and carbonyl regions) 
were scaled with the factors $f_q = 0.8$ and $f_\sigma = 0.89$  \cite{melcr18}.


Here, we apply the ECC to the Amber based lipid17 parameters \cite{lipid17-future} of POPS lipid with
a total monovalent negative charge. 
In this case we treat the POPS lipids like ions
applying to it the scaling factor of $f_q = 0.75$,
as it carries a physical total charge similar to the ions in solution, 
and the lipid charges has to neutralize the counterion charges in simulations.
For the Lennard-Jones~$\sigma$ parameters, we used the same scaling factor of $f_\sigma = 0.89$
as in the ECC-POPC model \cite{melcr18}.
%we used exactly the pre-determined scaling factor 
%to represent the effects of electronic polarization
%yielding a total charge of $-0.75$ in the ECC formalism. \cite{martinek17, leontyev09, melcr18}
Similarly to the ECC-POPC model \cite{melcr18}, we applied the ECC only to the
non-tail atoms, i.e., to atoms in the headgroup, glycerol backbone, and carbonyl regions. 
%polar parts of the phospholipid,
%i.e., charges on all atoms except on alkyl tails, 
%which do not encounter direct contacts with ions. 


%\subsection{Validation of membrane properties}
% SAMULI: I have dissolved this section into results and discussion

\subsection{Measurements of acyl chain order parameters}
A R-type Proton Detected Local Field (R-PDLF) experiment was performed to determine C--H bond order
parameters, $S_{\rm{CH}}=1/2\langle3cos^2\theta-1\rangle$, where $\theta$ denotes the angle of the C--H bond
with the bilayer normal and the angular brackets define a time average on a time scale of approximately 1 microsecond.
The experiment was done using a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer operating at a 1H Larmor frequency of 400.03 MHz
equipped with a standard 4 mm CP-MAS HXY probe. The set up of the R-PDLF experiment was the following
(using the notation as in figures 1c and 2c of the original reference for the R-PDLF
experiment [S. V. Dvinskikh, H. Zimmermann, A. Maliniak and D. Sandström, J. Mag. Res. 168, 194 (2004)]).
The magic angle spinning (MAS) frequency used was 5.15 kHz. The recoupling pulses in the R18 blocks had
therefore a length of 10.79 us which correspond to a nutation frequency of 46.35 kHz. Increments of 18x2 recoupling
pulses where used giving a spectral width of 2.6 kHz in the indirect dimension and a total number of 32 points in
the indirect dimension were recorded. These settings enable to record dipolar slices with a C--H bond order parameter
resolution of +- 0.01. The C--H bond order parameter determined from a given dipolar
splitting, $\Delta\nu$ (see e.g. Figure XX as SI) is equal to $\Delta\nu/(0.315\times21.5 kHz)$, where 0.315 is
the scaling factor of the R18 recoupling sequence and 21.5 kHz is the maximum 1H-13C dipolar coupling for a C--H bond.
The refocused-INEPT transfer [G. Morris and R. Freeman, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 101, 760 (1979); D. Burum, R. Ernst, J. Mag. Res. 39, 163 (1980)]
was used for transferring the polarization from 1H nuclei to the covalently bond 13C nuclei with the delays $\tau_1$ = 1.94 ms and $\tau_2$ = 0.97 ms
(set as multiples of the MAS rotation period). The pulses for the refocused-INEPT sequence had a nutation frequency equal to 63.45 kHz.
For acquiring the spectra, a total number of 1024 transients were recorded for each point in the indirect dimension, using an acquisition time of 0.1 s under SPINAL64 1H decoupling [B. Fung, A. Khitrin, K.Ermolaev, J. Mag. Res. 142, 97 (2000)] with a nutation frequency of 50 kHz, and with dwell time giving a spectral width of 200 ppm for the 13C chemical shift dimension. The set of free induction decays recorded were then processed as described e.g. in [T. M. Ferreira, B. Medronho, R. W. Martin, D. Topgaard, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 10, 6033 (2008)]. For assigning the dipolar splittings in the crowded spectral region between 29 and 30 ppm both the assignments made for POPC in [ T. M. Ferreira, F. Coreta- Gomes, O. H. S. Ollila, M. J. Moreno, W. L. C. Vaz, D. Topgaard, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 15, 1976-1989 (2013)] and the POPS order parameters simulated and reported in this work were taken as a reference.

MD simulations of POPC:POPS lipid bilayers with different molar ratios 
and ion concentrations (\ce{K^+}, \ce{Na^+}, \ce{Ca^{2+}} and \ce{Cl^{-}})
were performed in an orthorhombic simulation box with periodic boundary conditions
using the GROMACS 2018 \cite{Abraham15} simulation package.

\todo{EDIT: Taken from NMRlipids4 as an interesting information, to be edited.}
In the experimental $^2$H NMR literature data used in this work~\cite{browning80,roux90},
the lipids were first soluted to the buffer and then centrifuged to a pellet which
was used in the measurements. Such samples have lower lipid concentration
(approximately 10~wt~\% of lipids~\cite{browning80,roux88,roux90}) than 
gravimetric samples (60~wt~\%) and simulations (approximately 50-60~wt~\%) in this work.
Larger multilamellar repeat distances are expected in the samples with lower lipid
concentrations due to the swelling caused by electrostatic repulsion in pure PS lipid systems~\cite{millman82}.
However, the PS headgroup order parameters measured from gravimetric sample in this work
are in good agreement with the results from centrifuged sample in the literature \cite{browning80} (Fig. \ref{HGorderParameters}).
Furthermore, the equlibrium repeat distance rapidly decreases with the addtion of monovalent
salts and is close to the simulation box sizes already above 500~mM concentrations~\cite{millman82,rand89}.
Therefore, the hydration levels of multilamellae are expected to be sufficiently similar
in the used simulations and reference experiments.


In the reference simulations with the standard Amber force field,
we used the Lipid14 parameters~\cite{dickson14} for POPC, the Lipid17 parameters for POPS \cite{lipid17-future},
the TIP3P water model~\cite{jorgensen83}, and ion models by Dang and coworkers~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006}.
The Lipid14 parameters in Gromacs format were downloaded from Ref.~\citenum{lipid14files}. 
The Lipid17 parameters were obtained from AmberTools18 \cite{amber18} 
and they were converted to Gromacs format using acpype \cite{acpype}.  
The ion model by Dang and coworkers~\cite{smith94,chang1999,dang2006} was used with Amber lipids because
analysis of simulations with the default Amber ion parameters is complicated by the artificial
clustering of ions in solution \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}.
In the simulations with ECC-lipids,
we used the ECC-POPC parameters~\cite{melcr18} (available at \cite{ECC-POPC_nacl_cacl2_files}) and 
ECC-POPS parameteres derived in this work (section \ref{section:ecc}) 
together with the SPC/E~\cite{Berendsen1987} water model and 
ECC-ions \cite{martinek17, kohagen16, Pluharova2014}.
We used the SPC/E water model as its lower dielectric constant is consistent with the
ECC concept \cite{leontyev11,leontyev14}.

The C--H bond order parameters were first averaged over the time for individual lipids and
then the standard error of the mean of the average over lipids was used as the error estimate
of the mean \cite{botan15,ollila16,nmrlipids_proj4}.

\section{Results and Discussion} 
 
\subsection{Structural parameters of a pure ECC-POPS model membrane: Agreement with experiments} 
 
The form factors from scattering and C-H bond order parameters from NMR experiments are good measures to validate
the lipid bilayer structure in MD simulations against experiments because they
are related to the bilayer dimensions (area per molecule and thickness) and
conformational fluctuations of individual lipids, respectively, and 
can be directly calculated from MD simulations~\cite{ollila16}.
The X-ray scattering form factors and C-H bond order parameters in
the headgroup and glycerol backbone region of POPS lipid bilayer are already available in the literature \cite{pan14,nmrlipids_proj4}.
Here, we extend the available experimental dataset of POPS lipids by measuring the C--H bond
order parameters also from the acyl chain region using the R-PDLF experiments as described previously \cite{ferreira13}.
We first determined the order parameters of each peak corresponding different C--H bonds detected
in the first dimension (Fig. \ref{R-PDLF}) from the dipolar slices in the indirect dimension (Fig. \ref{R-PDLFslices}).
Because the exact assignment of these peaks was not possible, we assigned the
acyl chain order parameters to mimic the profile predicted by the MD simulations (Fig. \ref{simVSexpNOions_POPS}).

To evaluate the effect of ECC on the structural properties of POPS lipid bilayer,
we compared the X-ray scattering form factors, C--H bond order parameters and area per molecules
between simulation with original Lipid17 \cite{??} combined with the Dang ion parameters \cite{??},
ECC-POPS simulation and experiments (Fig. \ref{simVSexpNOions_POPS} and table \ref{tab:apls}).
The larger acyl chain order parameters, deviation in the form factor and smaller area per molecule 
in the Lipid17 simulation with Dang ions when compared with experiments indicates that this simulation
predicts too dense lipid bilayer. In previous study \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}, Lipid17 simulated with {\AA}qvist ions~\cite{aqvist90}
gave larger area per molecule (57 \AA$^2$), probably due to the weaker counterion binding affinity.
The Dang ions are used to here to avoid the artificial pairing of ions and condensation at larger salt
concentrations observed with {\AA}qvist \cite{kohagen16, chen07, nmrlipids_proj4} when analysing the effect of ECC. 
The scattering form factors and acyl chain order parameters from ECC-POPS are in good agreement with
experiments (see Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions_POPS}), indicating the the bilayer dimensions and acyl chain
conformations are well described by the force field. The area per lipid from ECC-POPS simulation is slightly
smaller than the value reported from SDP model \cite{kucerka14} (table \ref{tab:apls}), but the values
are within each others error bars. 
%In order to obtain the area per lipid from experiments, modeling is used on top of the scattering factors \citep{kucerka14}. 
%In ocntrast, this property is easily extracted directly from simulations with flat phospholipid bilayers. 
%We compare the values from experiments and simulations in Table~\ref{tab:apls}. 
%While the agreement between the scattering form factors from the simulation of a pure POPS bilayer and experiment 
%are excellent (Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions_POPS}), there is a non-negligible difference between the values of the area per lipid in Table~\ref{tab:apls}. 
%Since both values are derived from the scattering form factors through modeling of the electron density of the bilayer,
%we cannot decide, which of the values is more reliable.

    and I think that it is more clear if we refer only to the NMRlipids IV result in the text.

\end{table} 

Despite the success in simulating bilayer dimensions and acyl chain conformations,
lipid force fields have typically problems in capturing the correct glycerol backbone and
headgroup order parameters and conformations \cite{botan15,ollila16,nmrlipids_proj4}.
This is the case also for Lipid17 POPS simulations, where the headgroup and glycerol backbone
order parameters are quite far from experimental values with both Dang (Fig. \ref{simVSexpNOions_POPS})
and {\AA}qvist \cite{nmrlipids_proj4} ions. The values from ECC-POPS simulation are closer,
but not in full agreement with experiments (Fig. \ref{simVSexpNOions_POPS}).
Especially, the experimentally observed more negative values of the $\beta$-carbon
and the larger forking (difference of order parameters between hydrogens attached to the
same carbon) of the $\alpha$-carbon in POPS than in POPC \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}
are not reproduced by neither of the models here. These differences are previously related
to a more rigid structure of PS headgroup and the stiffness of the C$_\alpha$-C$_\beta$-C$_\gamma$-O$_\gamma$
dihedral, which is \todo{the dihedral should be plotted and sentence finished.}

%The head group order parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are highly relevant for this work,
%as they are being used in the electrometer concept \cite{altenbach84, catte16, melcr18}.
%For POPC in pure water, the order parameter $\beta$ agrees well with the experiment, while the order parameter $\alpha$ is somewhat lower. 

In conclusion, the ECC-POPS model reproduces the lipid bilayer dimensions and
acyl chain conformations in good agreement with experiments, but has room for
improvement in the glycerol backbone and headgroup region. Therefore,
its structural accuracy is in the same level as in other state-of-the-art
lipid force fields \cite{botan15, ollila16, Pluhackova2016, nmrlipids_proj4}.
 
 
\subsection{Counterion binding affinity and interactions between PC and PS head groups}

Binding affinity of monovalent ions to lipid bilayers depends strongly on
force field parameters \cite{catte16,melcr18,nmrlipids_proj4},
which is the case also here as the sodium binding affinity to
POPS lipid bilayer is stronger in Lipid17 simulation with Dang ions than in
ECC-POPS simulation (Fig. \ref{fig:POPS-counterions-dens}).
The cation binding affinities to lipid bilayers in simulations have been previously evaluated
against experiments using the order parameters of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ carbons in the
phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid headgroup (see Fig.~\ref{fig:chemstruct_pc_ps} for the labeling) \cite{catte16,melcr18,nmrlipids_proj4},
which decrease proportionally to the bound charge according to the ''electrometer concept'' \citep{seelig87}.
Althought the response of PS lipid headgroup order parameters to the bound charge is also systematic,
it is less well undestood and the addition of cations may cause phase transitions in negatively charged
bilayers \cite{feigenson86,mattai89,roux91,roux90}. Therefore, the cation binding affinity to bilayers with
PS lipids has been evaluated measuring the PC headgroup order parameters from POPC:POPS (5:1)
mixtures\cite{roux90,nmrlipids_proj4}.
Following our previous work \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}, we evaluate the counterion binding affinity
to lipid bilayer in simulations containing PS using two different approaches.

% The situation is more complicated for lipid bilayers containing
%PS lipids, for which there is no ion-free reference state due to the presence of counterions.

%Unlinke in pure PC bilayers,
%Interpreting the changes of the head group order parameters of 
%mixed PC:PS lipid bilayers 
%from both simulations and experiments
%is complicated by the presence of counterions. \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}

%This was demonstrated for a bound positive charge in simulations with POPC and

%We attempted to find a model, 
%which would successfully interpret the experiments on binding of \ce{Na^+}
%to neutral and negatively charged phospholipid bilayers \citep{akutsu81, roux90} 
%in our works \citep{catte16, nmrlipids_proj4}.
%After testing the currently available force fields for phospholipids,
%we concluded
%that the interactions are generally overestimated in magnitude in almost all models 
%but Lipid14 (PC) \citep{dickson14}, resp. Lipid17 (PS) \citep{lipid17-future}. 
%This model yields a semi-quantitative agreement with the experimentally measured small changes of the order parameters \cite{catte16}
%when used with the model of ions by \citet{aqvist90}. 
%However, when used with a more accurate model of ions by \citet{Pluharova2014, martinek17},
%the model overestimates the binding affinity of \ce{Na^+}
%measured with lipid electrometer concept. \citep{melcr18}
%In total, these results suggest that improvements 
%in the lipid parameters are required for more accurate interactions even with monovalent cations. 
%\citep{catte16, melcr18, nmrlipids_proj4}

First, we monitor the response of POPC headgroup order parameters to the increasing amount of POPS (Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PC-PS_mix}).
According to the electrometer concept, the head group order parameters of PC lipids increase
with the increasing amount of negatively charged PS lipids in experiments, because the headgroup P--N dipole
tilts more parallel to the membrane interface \cite{seelig87,scherer87}.
The trend is observed with both force fields in simulations with \ce{K+} counterions and
in ECC-POPS simulation with \ce{Na+} counterions, but not in Lipid17/Dang ion simulations with \ce{Na+} counterions,
where the order parameters are unchanged or decrease and the P--N vector tilts more perpendicular to the membrane interface.
The result can be explained by the higher binding affinity of sodium in the
Lipid17/Dang ion simulations (Fig~\ref{fig:POPS-counterions-dens}), which
compensates the negative charge of PS lipids at the interface.

    and experiments (only \ce{Na^+} counterions, but shown also in bottom plots). \cite{roux90}. 
    The underestimated response of ECC-lipids with \ce{Na^+} counterions 
    is likely due to a still slightly overestimated binding affinity of \ce{Na^+} to the phospholipids,
    which is corroborated by the series with \ce{K^+} counterions (lower affinity than \ce{Na^+}),
    where the response is closer to the experiment, which uses only \ce{Na^+} counterions.

\end{figure*} 


Second, we monitor the response of PC headgroup order parameters to the additional
amount of sodium and potassium in POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures.
In experiments, the addition of K$^+$ ions led to a very modest decrease of the order parameters,
while the decrease was more pronounced with Li$^+$ ions and strongest with divalent Ca$^{2+}$ and Mg$^{2+}$ ions \cite{roux90}.
According to the electrometer concept, the decrease of PC lipid head group order parameters
correlates with the amount of bound cations \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87,roux90,catte16,nmrlipids_proj4},
thus the binding affinity of the ions to POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures increase in order K$^{+}$ $<$ Li$^{+}$  $<$ Mg$^{2+}$  $<$ Ca$^{2+}$.
The response of PC headgroup order parameters to the increasing amount of KCl is close to experiments
and the change in P--N vector is negligible in both force fields (Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_KCl_PCPS}), athought the change of the $\alpha$-carbon
order parameter may be slightly overestimated by the Lipid17/Dang simulations. This could be
explained by the slightly deeper penetration of potassium into the bilayer (Fig. \ref{fig:POPS-counterions-dens}).
Because experimental data with the additional amount of sodium in POPC:POPS (5:1) mixture was not available,
we compared the simulation results to the experimental data with the additional amounts of
lithium and potassium ions, which should give the lower and upper bounds to the sodium binding
affinity (Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PCPS}). The PC headgroup response to the additional
amount of sodium is clearly overestimated by the Lipid17/Dang simulation and
the response in ECC-POPS simulations is probably too close to the experimental results for lithium.
In conclusion, the results suggest that the sodium binding affinity (Fig. \ref{fig:POPS-counterions-dens}) and
the tilting of P--N vector more perpendicular to the membrane surface (Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PCPS})
are clearly overestimated in Lipid17/Dang simulations and slightly overestimated in ECC-POPS simulations,
while 
%In conclusion, the response of PC
%headgroups to added amount of PS and to the added amount of ions suggest that the Lipid17/Dang
%simulations sinficantly overestimate the sodium binding affinity to the PS containing lipid bilayers, while
%ECC-POPS simulations give results closer to the experiments, but may still slightly overestimate
%the binding affinity.
the binding affinity of potassium is better described by both force fields.

%Generally improved behaviour 
%of the POPC and POPS head group order parameters 
%with \ce{NaCl} or \ce{KCl} concentrations 
%was achieved through the combination of models 
%ECC-lipids and ECC-ions \citep{martinek17, kohagen16, Pluharova2014}. 
%Simulations with these models 
%reveal a good agreement with the NMR experiments 
%for both neutral and negatively charged membranes.
%The results are plotted for \ce{NaCl} in Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PCPS}, 
%and for \ce{KCl} in Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_KCl_PCPS}. 


%The order parameters of the PS head groups including their changes with the content of PC lipids
%are challenging to capture correctly in classical MD simulation models. \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}
%From such a perspective,
%the changes of the PS head group order parameters from ECC-lipids 
%with \ce{Na+}, and also \ce{K+}, counterions 
%agree comparably well to the experimental measurements
%(Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PC-PS_mix}). 
%Interestingly enough, 
%although the Lipid17 model performed well with \ce{K+} counterions 
%for the PC head group order parameter changes,
%it does not agree in the equivalent changes in PS head groups
%pointing at non-negligible effects of even relatively weakly binding cations 
%on the structure of negatively charged lipids. 

%Despite the great improvements in the overall structure of ECC-POPS 
%and its response to PC lipids and counterions,
%there is still a large room for improving it
%to agree with the experimental measurements.

The changes of POPS headgroup order parameters are almost negligible in experiments with increasing POPC fraction in bilayer
or monovalent ion concentration in solvent
(Figs. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PCPS}, \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_KCl_PCPS} and \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PC-PS_mix}),
while calcium leads to relatively large changes with low concentrations followed by a rapid saturation below 100mM (Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS}) \cite{scherer87,roux90}.
%The interaction with \ce{K^+}, which binds very weakly to both neutral and negatively charged membranes, 
%renders a qualitatively different response of the order parameter $S^\beta$ in POPS 
%in the mixed negatively charged bilayers compared to the neutral bilayers. 
%While the order parameter $S^\beta$ increases for both \ce{Na^+} and \ce{Ca^{2+}},
%it decreases in the presence of \ce{K^+}
%(\ce{KCl}:  Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_KCl_PCPS}, 
% \ce{NaCl}: Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PCPS}, and
%\ce{CaCl2}: Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS}). 
In Lipid17/Dang simulations, the changes of POPS headgroup order parameters with increasing amount of POPC
are overestimated, which is also related to the changes in the orientations of the P--N and C$_{\beta}$--C$_{\gamma}$
vectors (Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PC-PS_mix}). The overestimation of the order parameter changes
was also observed in previous simulations with other force fields \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}, but not in
ECC-POPS simulation, where also the changes in the PS headgroup orientation are more modest (Fig. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PC-PS_mix}).
Also, the POPS headgroup orientation and order parameters are more sensitive to the additional amount
of sodium and potassium in Lipid17/Dang simulations, while dependence is weaker and closer to experiments
in ECC-POPS simulations (Figs. \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PCPS} and \ref{fig:delta_ordPar_KCl_PCPS}).
%In contrast, ECC-lipids with ECC-ions capture the different response 
%of the order parameters $S^{\beta}$, $S^{\alpha _1}$ and $S^{\alpha _2}$ in POPS 
%to various concentrations of \ce{NaCl} and \ce{KCl} in a good agreement with the experiments
%(\ce{KCl}:  Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_KCl_PCPS}, 
% \ce{NaCl}: Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_NaCl_PCPS}). 
%Such a dramatic improvement in the structural parameters 
%demonstrates that including electronic polarization in phospholipids is crucial 
%even for interactions with soft cations like \ce{K^+}. 
In conclusion, using ECC to POPS lipid headgroup improves its
interactions with monovalent ions and POPC headgroups when compared with NMR order parameter data,
althought there is room for improvement in the sodium binding affinity.

\subsection{Molecular interaction and binding affinities of \ce{Ca^{2+}} cations to mixed POPC:POPS (5:1) membrane} 
\label{section:lip-ion_ca}

The headgroup order parameters of PC lipids decrease more upon addition of \ce{CaCl2}
in POPC:POPS (5:1) mixtures than in pure PC bilayers due to the higher calcium binding
affinity to the negatively charged lipid bilayers \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,roux90,nmrlipids_proj4}.
Following our previous work \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}, we use the experimental
headgroup order parameter data as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration
from POPC:POPS (5:1) mixture to evaluate the calcium binding affinity to lipid bilayers containing PS lipids.
The decrease of the PC headgroup order parameters upon addition of \ce{CaCl2} 
is overestimated in the Lipid17/Dang simulation, while ECC-POPS simulations give results
closer to the experiments (Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS}). 
This indicates that the lower binding affinity of calcium in ECC-POPS
simulation is more realistic (Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens_PCPS}).
\todo{JOE: The density plot still needs to be changed to show both Lipid17 and ECC-lipids, and to support this argument.}
However, the steep decrease of the order parameters at low calcium concentrations
observed especially in the negatively charged bilayers is not captured by the ECC-lipid simulations.

%The binding of calcium cations to the phospholipid bilayer is shown 
%in the density profiles of \ce{Ca^{2+}}, \ce{Na^+} counterions 
%and also \ce{Cl^-} ions in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl-dens_PCPS}. 
%Clearly, after accounting for the electronic polarizability, 
%the population of the cations at the membrane interface is significantly diminished.

\end{figure} 


The structural changes in POPS induced by increasing concentrations of \ce{CaCl2} 
are very challenging to interpret from both experiments \cite{roux90} 
and also from MD simulations \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}. 
The changes of the order parameters $S^\alpha$ and $S^\beta$ in PS head groups from simulations 
are not found to follow the experimental profiles, 
nor any common trend,
with the currently available models \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}. 
In Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS},
we plot these structural parameters for one of the models in that work, Lipid17, 
and for ECC-lipids. 
Although the agreement between ECC-lipids and experiments is not optimal,
the general trends and behaviour even at highly concentrated solutions of \ce{CaCl2} 
are well captured by the model. 
For example the order parameter $\beta$ in POPS 
adopts a saturated value in experiments and ECC-lipids,
but it is growing with the \ce{CaCl2} concentration in Lipid17.
In addition, 
the forking of the order parameters $\alpha$ 
is almost constant in the experiment and ECC-lipids,
but it varies greatly in th Lipid17. 

The source of this discrepancy may arise from the interactions between PC and PS lipids and with \ce{Na^+} counterions,
from the sub-optimal structure of the lipids (Fig.~\ref{simVSexpNOions_POPS},
and also possibly from the approximate mean-field treatment of the electronic polarization. 






It has been pointed out in previous experimental works
that the conformational flexibility of PS head groups 
is different from other lipids \cite{browning80}. 
While the static shielding tensor of PS is not substantially different from PC or PE, 
the $^{31}$P~$T_1$ relaxation times are significantly shorter for PS. 
It is suggested that the PS head group is more rigid compared to the other phospholipids, 
which is also corroborated by a larger chemical shielding anisotropy of PS \cite{browning80}. 

We have investigated this effect using the mean orientations of P-N and \ce{COO^-} vectors 
(defined and plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS}). 
While the mean angle between the P-N vector of PC head group and the membrane normal
decreased by 11$^\circ$ from 64$^\circ$ to 55$^\circ$
 at 620~mM buffer concentration of \ce{CaCl2},
the mean orientation of the P-N vector in the PS head group has 
decreased only by 3$^\circ$ from 67$^\circ$ to 64$^\circ$ 
in the same concentration range. 

Such a largely diminished flexibility 
may arise from the binding of calcium to the \ce{COO^-} group in PS. 
Whe have measured the mean orientation of the \ce{COO^-} group 
as the connector of the carbon atoms 
forming the bond between the group and the $\beta$-carbon of the phospholipid 
(Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS}).
The mean angle between the \ce{COO^-} vector and the membrane normal
changes by $11^\circ$ from $62^\circ$ to $73^\circ$ (more towards the membrane interior)
 at 620~mM buffer concentration of \ce{CaCl2}.
The conformational flexibility of the PS head group is hence restrained 
by the binding of calcium cations to the \ce{COO^-} group, 
which reorients towards the membrane interior and to the phosphate region, 
where calcium cations bind predominantly.

\end{figure} 
 


Still, the dominant contribution to the binding of calcium comes from the phosphate groups. 
Interestingly enough,
although the \ce{COO^-} groups increase the affinity of calcium towards PS compared to PC,
 there is no extra density at the outmost surface of the membrane. 
This can be understood from the point of the structural rearangements of the \ce{COO^-} group, 
which take place during the interactions with calcium cations
described above and in Fig.~\ref{fig:delta_ordPar_CaCl_PCPS}.

% Gamma and higher affinity of PS to CA2+
The higher affinity of calcium to PS head groups compared to PC
is well demonstrated using the relative surface excess, $\Gamma ^w _{Ca}$,
summarized in Table~\ref{tab:binding}. 
While $\Gamma^{w}_{Ca}$ at a neutral POPC bilayer
is       $\Gamma^{w}_{Ca} = 0.06\mathrm{nm^{-2}}$      \cite{melcr18}, 
its value for the PC:PS (5:1) bilayer is $\Gamma^{w}_{Ca} = 0.24\mathrm{nm^{-2}}$
at comparable buffer concentrations  $350 \, \mathrm{mM}$ resp. $400\, \mathrm{mM}$. 


% Description of no. conctacts counting
Such a significantly increased binding also has an impact 
on the structure and populations of the bound calcium cations. 
We have counted contacts between the cations and the oxygen atoms of the lipids
similarly as was done in \cite{melcr18} 
to obtain such a detailed information 
about the interactions of \ce{Ca^{2+}} with various moieties in POPC or POPS. 
The threshold for counting a contact was set to $0.3\,\mathrm{nm}$, 
which encompasses the first peak of the radial distribution function between the cations and the oxygen atoms of the lipids. 

% Populations from contacts
The percentages of the populations of membrane-bound calcium cations for various membrane moieties 
are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:binding}.
Even though the negatively charged membrane contains only 18\% of POPS, 
on average 41\% of the total population of bound calcium cations is in contact with PS lipids
with 8\% bound only to them. 
% Where Calcium interacts
While POPC interacts with the calcium cations almost entirely through its phosphate group 
in both neutral \cite{melcr18} and negatively charged membranes, 
the inteaction with POPS lipids happens more through the \ce{COO^-} group than through the \ce{PO4} group. 
Interactions of \ce{Ca^{2+}} with carbonyl groups are also present for both POPC and POPS,
however, they are always accompanied by interactions with phosphate groups. 
This is in contrast to 
simulations with the Berger force field \cite{berger97,mukhopadhyay04}
combined with fluorescent and vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy,
which suggest a significant
calcium binding also to the carbonyls groups \cite{melcrova16}. 
This feature arises likely from the inaccuracy of the Berger model 
and its overestimated binding of cations to that region \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}. 

Measurements using infrared spectroscopy 
combined with simulations with the CHARMM36 model 
with a correction for overestimated binding of calcium \cite{valentine18}
reveal similar trends for the populations at various PS moieties
suggesting that POPS interacts mostly through its \ce{COO^-} group. 
While this feature agrees nicely with our findings, 
the balance of the interactions of PS moieties with calcium cations may be suboptimal
and the interaction strength underestimated in total in those simulations \cite{nmrlipids_proj4}. 

In contrast, the combination of NMR experiments 
and MD simulations with the same model, CHARMM36, but without the correction for calcium binding
also reveal long-lived interactions of \ce{Ca^{2+}} with \ce{PO4} groups. \cite{hallock18}
Although the ratios of the life times of coordination follow the same trends as in our work,
the lengths of simulation trajectories are insufficient 
to yield converged results in this aspect (see SI and Refs.~\cite{catte16, melcr18, nmrlipids_proj4}). 
Moreover, the content of POPS in the bilayers in that work is
much higher above the threshold after which 
\ce{Ca^{2+}} cations induce lipid clustering. \cite{hauser77,kurland79,hauser85,feigenson86,mattai89,roux90,roux91}
At such a high content of negatively charged lipids,
PS head groups are found to form even four-membered clusters \cite{hallock18}. 
Our simulations are, however, at different conditions,
in which the clustering of POPS does not happen, 
and PS lipids prefer 1:1 ratio with \ce{Ca^{2+}}
as plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:cacl_complexes}
showing relative probabilities of \ce{Ca^{2+}} complexes with a certain number of PC or PS lipids. 
Compared to a neutral POPC bilayer
the negatively charged bilayer has its stoichiometry 
shifted towards complexes with three phospholipids and one calcium. 
This is obviously due to the presence of POPS, 
which also contributes to the pre-formed one- and two-membered clusters of POPC. 
Clusters of four or more lipids were not observed in either membrane. 



 
\todo{ THE REMAINING PIECES TO BE DISCUSSED  --  consider wheter the dynamics slowdown or the dihedral distributions could make good contributions to this paper. }


% Ca2+ induces much slower dynamics of lipids when PS is present,
% this does not happen with PC
% uses NBFIX
From Ref.~\cite{valentine18}://
To summarize, calcium binding to PS lipids slows the dynamics at the ester position and introduces more heterogeneous molecular environments. 
The slowdown cannot be attributed to complete ester dehydration or decreased hydrogen bonding to water, so we interpret these results as evidence that the lipid headgroups adopt more rigid but disordered conformations on the molecular level. 
The decrease in dynamics observed experimentally indicates that the network of hydrogen bonds between lipids and water at the polar-nonpolar interface becomes slower, as it was shown by Karathanou and Bondar (34). 
This is bolstered by recent NMR work showing that binding to Ca2+ induces two different rigid conformations in the glycerol backbone of lipid headgroups (18).
We have investigated the molecular origin of the rigidification and decreased lateral diffusion, finding that calcium binding does not dehydrate the ester region, but even with only 10\% PS lipids, the local dynamics slow around the esters. The slower local dynamics provide a molecular explanation for the Ca2+-dependent decreases in fluidity observed on longer length and timescales.
There is considerable room for further improvement in the force fields for ion-membrane interactions. Particularly, small differences in short-range interactions may determine the local geometries (34
). Most of our conclusions are, however, based on long-range effects (i.e., electric field generated by the ion at significant distances from the carbonyl groups), which are less sensitive to the details of the force field. 



Their Figure 5 \cite{hallock18} shows the distributions of O-Ca-Cb-N dihedral angle
revealing separate populations of the PS head groups. 
These two structures are also compared in therm of P-Cg distances, 
which can be measured from NMR REDOR exp. 
It is concluded that since the two distinct populations in P-Cg distance can be represented with the 
dihedral distributions, 
they also likely represent the distinct populations. 
 -> plotting the distribution of O-Ca-Cb-N dihedral angle may be also a good idea for us (SI?)
     -> NMRlipids 4 in SI \cite{nmrlipids_proj4} plots this information: 
           - C36 agress with the distribution in \cite{hallock18}
           - Lipid17 (and Slipids) are almost identical to C36
           - but the structure of the COO- is highly different (dih angle Ca-Cb-Cg-Og)

\section{Conclusions} 

\todo{SAMULI: I have putted here two preliminary sentences
JOSEF: I can write conclusions, but I would prefer to wait with that after your comments and edits. }
Applying ECC to POPS lipids improves cation binding affinity to membranes
mixed with POPC and also the response of PS headgroup to the bound cations.
However, further improvement of the parameters is needed to fully reproduce the
details of calcium binding to PS headgroups.

\section{SI}

Timescales associated with the binding of calcium cations from solution to the membrane
are plotted for each binding event as a histogram in Fig.~\ref{fig:hist_residence_times}. 
Using these plots, we can estimate that 90\% of the residence times of any calcium cation 
will be lower than $60\,\mathrm{ns}$ for pure POPC neutral bilayer 
and shorter than $200\,\mathrm{ns}$ for the mixed 5\,PC:1\,PS negatively charged bilayer. 
The longest observed residence times in the simulations were $141\,\mathrm{ns}$ for the neutral membrane 
and $485\,\mathrm{ns}$ for the negatively charged membrane. 
Both estimates of the residence times come from simulations with comparable concentrations of around $250\mathrm{mM}$;
the simulation with the neutral membrane has a bulk concentration of calcium $C_{ion} = 280\mathrm{mM}$, 
whereas the simulation with the negatively charged membrane has a bulk concentration of calcium $C_{ion} = 240\mathrm{mM}$.

   shorter than $200\,\mathrm{ns}$, % exactly $53\,\mathrm{ns}$                                                                          
   with the longest observed residence time being $485\,\mathrm{ns}$. 
   Simulation data for POPC bilayers were taken directly from \cite{melcr18}.

In summary, the results from ECC-lipids suggest 
that the exchange of calcium between the POPC bilayer and the solvent 
occurs at the order of $\sim$10--100~ns, 
which is significantly faster than observed in simulations 
with other presently available non-polarizable models of lipids and ions~\citep{javanainen17, catte16}. 
Our results suggest 
that simulation trajectories with a characteristic length of several hundreds of nanoseconds 
are necessary to capture the binding of calcium to neutral POPC bilayers 
in equilibrium when more realistic \emph{polarizable} force fields are used. 
Interestingly enough, almost an order of magnitude longer simulations
are required for the negatively charged bilayers.
