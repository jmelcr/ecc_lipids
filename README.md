# ECC-lipids

Tracking the development of ECC-lipids - 
classical MD lipid models with 
implicitly embedded electronic polarization
through Electronic Continuum Correction ([ECC](TODO:LINK TO MY SITE)).

Directory structure and working style is highly inspired by 
open-collaboration [NMRLipids projects](https://nmrlipids.blogspot.cz/),
with its [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/NMRLipids).

Repository [MATCH](https://github.com/NMRLipids/MATCH) is often also employed 
as a data source and a tool with analysis scripts.
