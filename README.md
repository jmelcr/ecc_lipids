# ECC-lipids

ECC-lipids is a classical MD lipid force field with 
implicit embedding of the electronic polarization
through the Electronic Continuum Correction ([ECC](https://jmelcr.github.io/blog/ECC-post)).
This correction is important for accurate interactions 
with charged molecules, cation and anions, 
like sodium or divalent calcium cations. 


# Quick start

Starting a new simulation with ECC-lipids is very easy. 
Pre-equilibrated structures with run parameters and topologies 
are availible from the ECC-lipids publications and from to list below. 
Also, since the molecular topology of ECC-lipdis 
is designed to agree with CHARMM lipids,
ECC-lipids can be used directly 
with the membrane structures generated by 
[charmm-gui.](http://charmm-gui.org/)
after changing only topology files (GROMACS format only). 
Equilibrated CHARMM structures can be also downloaded 
from the [lipid membrane simulation database](http://www.nmrlipids.fi/) 
generated by the [NMRlipids project](http://nmrlipids.blogspot.com/). 
An example topology for ECC-lipids is given in 
[topologies/ecc-lipids](https://github.com/jmelcr/ecc_lipids/tree/master/topologies/ecc-lipids).


### Amber Lipid14-compatible topologies
If you require Amber-like topology, you can use AmberTools to
make bilayers for Lipid14 and use the ECC-lipidds topology with
the Amber-like conventions, 
e.g. [Amber-like ECC-POPC](https://github.com/jmelcr/ecc_lipids/blob/master/topologies/ecc-lipids/ecc-popc/ECC-POPC_amber-lipid14-atomic-names.itp). 
The difference between the Amber-like resp. CHARMM-like
topologies are only in the atomic naming and ordering conventions, and
they generate identical results.

## notes

The directory structure and working style of this repository
is highly inspired by open-collaboration [NMRLipids projects](https://nmrlipids.blogspot.cz/),
with its [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/NMRLipids).

Repository [MATCH](https://github.com/NMRLipids/MATCH) is often also employed 
as a data source and a tool with analysis scripts.

Gromacs compatible parameters for ECC-ions (and many other ions)
are maintained at a [separate repository.](https://bitbucket.org/hseara/ions)
