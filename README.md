# ECC-lipids

Tracking the development of ECC-lipids - 
classical MD lipid models with 
implicitly embedded electronic polarization
through Electronic Continuum Correction ([ECC](https://jmelcr.github.io/blog/ECC-post)).

Directory structure and working style is highly inspired by 
open-collaboration [NMRLipids projects](https://nmrlipids.blogspot.cz/),
with its [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/NMRLipids).

Repository [MATCH](https://github.com/NMRLipids/MATCH) is often also employed 
as a data source and a tool with analysis scripts.

Gromacs compatible parameters for ECC-ions (and many other ions)
are maintained at a [separate repository.](https://bitbucket.org/hseara/ions)

## Quick start

Starting a new simulation with ECC-lipids is very easy. 
As the molecular topology agrees with CHARMM lipids,
ECC-lipid topology can be used directly 
with the membrane structures generated by 
[charmm-gui.](http://charmm-gui.org/)
An example topology is given in 
[topologies/ecc-lipids](https://github.com/jmelcr/ecc_lipids/tree/master/topologies/ecc-lipids).
